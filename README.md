# Cordova Swift 3 Plugin Example

Example Cordova plugin for iOS to support blog post.  The native part of the plugin is written in Swift rather than Objective-C.  This has been updated to use Swift 3 / XCode 8.2 / Cordova 6.4.

A simple Cordova plugin based on the [ModusEcho plugin](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/cordova-plugin-example) example, which in turn was based on the echo plugin example from the [Cordova documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html).

* `echo` method: Extends that example to display a native dialog on iOS that auto dismisses after a short time.
* `echojs` method: Basic demo showing that plugins can also be used to organize and distribute useful JavaScript, and don't need native implementations necessarily.
